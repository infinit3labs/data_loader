# Quickstart

This guide helps you get the data loader running using **Poetry**.

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Run tests to verify the installation
poetry run pytest
```

## Running the demo

```bash
# Execute the demo script
poetry run python demo/run_demo.py
```

The demo uses `demo/demo_config.yaml` to showcase the configuration driven
workflow. Edit this file to experiment with different settings.
